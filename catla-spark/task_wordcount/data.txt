Configuration parameters significantly influence the performance of running MapReduce jobs on Hadoop and Spark. Manual tuning of parameters to optimize performance of big data analysis algorithms is time-consuming and tedious for general users. At present, most existing self-tuning systems have opaque implementation and are difficult to use in practice. To address these issues, this study presents an open-source project that hosts the developing self-tuning system on Hadoop and Spark called Catla-HS, which integrates multiple direct search and derivative-free optimization-based techniques to improve tuning efficiency. Catla-HS architecture and its tuning methods are first proposed. Then, simple usage examples are reported to demonstrate the benefits of this ongoing project, which is dedicated to contributing to Hadoop and Spark ecosystems in terms of rapid MapReduce performance tuning.
