## Catla-HS distribution

<b>src</b>: core source code of the project

<b>dist</b>: However, the distribution version of Catla-HS with full function support is available. So you can test all functions of this project using the jar file "catla.jar" following our documents. 

### Why is the project named Catla-HS?
<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catla'><b>Catla</b></a> is a fish with large and broad head, a large protruding lower jaw, and upturned mouth. It has large, greyish scales on its dorsal side and whitish on its belly. Catla is a surface and midwater feeder. 

The old version Catla is merely focusing on performance tuning on Hadoop. 

This newly-developed Catla-HS system explores optimal performance in the complicated environment both on Hadoop and Spark like a fish in an ocean.
